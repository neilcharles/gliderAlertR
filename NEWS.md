### Version 1.1

- Increased XC distances to trigger alert to 15 (winter) and 50 (summer) to reduce the number of alerts
- Removed '(No OGN Reg)' pilots from XC alerts
- Filtered duplicate pilot names in XC alerts to prevent people flying with additional devices from triggering multiple alerts
- Added minimum 300' AGL check to pilots triggering XC alerts to make sure they're airborne and not driving home
- Messages will no longer be sent in the hours of darkness, even if a device is detected near a takeoff
- Switched maps from glidernet to gliderradar, which has nicer maps, shows glider tracks and allows to link directly to an aircraft by its ID, so clicking a link will take you to a pilot's current position, even if they've moved since the alert was sent. Note that links to pilots on XC will display at zoom level 9 and  need to be manually zoomed in after clicking the link. A query has been raised with gliderradar devs for possibility of increasing zoom on direct links to glider ID's.
- Dunstable and nearby sites have been moved to a new Telegram group to separate them from the South East group
- *All groups* message broadcast function added
- Special celebratory message text when flights cross 100km, 200km etc.
